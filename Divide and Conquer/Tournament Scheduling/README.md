# Tournament Scheduling with Divide and Conquer

The tournament scheduling problem involves scheduling a round-robin tournament for n teams, where each team plays against every other team exactly once. The goal is to find an efficient schedule that minimizes the number of rounds required while ensuring that no team plays two games at the same time.

## Divide and Conquer Approach

One way to solve this problem is by using a divide-and-conquer approach. The idea is to split the set of teams into two halves, recursively schedule tournaments for each half, and then merge the schedules to obtain a complete schedule for the entire set of teams.

Here's how the algorithm works:

1. If there is only one team, return an empty schedule.
2. Divide the set of teams into two halves of roughly equal size.
3. Recursively schedule tournaments for each half.
4. Merge the schedules for the two halves by pairing up the matches in corresponding rounds.
5. Add matches between the two halves to the end of the schedule.
6. Return the complete schedule.

Step 4 is the key step that makes this algorithm work. To merge the schedules, we pair up the matches in corresponding rounds by shifting the second half of the matches by an offset of len(second_half_schedule) for each round. This ensures that no two teams play more than one match in the same round.

## Usage

To use the implementation provided in this repository, simply call the `tournament_schedule` function with a list of team names as input:

```python
teams = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
schedule = tournament_schedule(teams)
print(schedule)
```
Output:
```
[[('A', 'B'), ('C', 'D')], [('A', 'C'), ('B', 'D')], [('A', 'D'), ('B', 'C')]]
```

The output is a list of rounds, where each round is a list of matches. Each match is represented as a tuple of two team names.

Note that the implementation assumes that the number of teams is a power of two. If this is not the case, the function may still work correctly but the resulting schedule may not be optimal.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the divide-and-conquer approach provides an efficient way to solve the tournament scheduling problem. By recursively scheduling tournaments for smaller subsets of teams and then merging the schedules, we can obtain a complete schedule for the entire set of teams in a relatively short amount of time.
