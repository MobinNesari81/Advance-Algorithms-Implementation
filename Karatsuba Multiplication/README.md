# Karatsuba Multiplication Problem

The Karatsuba multiplication algorithm is an efficient method for multiplying two numbers. It was discovered by Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba in 1960 and has a time complexity of O(n^(log2(3))) â‰ˆ O(n^1.585) compared to the traditional long multiplication algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n^2).

The algorithm works by recursively breaking down the multiplication of two n-digit numbers into three multiplications of numbers with n/2 digits (plus some extra additions and subtractions). 

In this implementation, we use the Divide and Conquer approach to solve the problem.

## Divide and Conquer Approach

The Divide and Conquer approach involves dividing a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining the solutions to obtain the solution to the original problem. The algorithm works in four steps: divide, conquer, combine and return.

1. **Divide**: We split the two input numbers into two halves of n/2 digits each.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively compute three products of the two n/2 digit halves using the Karatsuba algorithm.
3. **Combine**: Use these products to compute the final product according to the Karatsuba formula.
4. **Return**: Return the final product.

The base case for recursion is when either of the input numbers is less than 10. At this point, the two numbers can be multiplied directly.

## Implementation

The implementation provided above uses a recursive function `karatsuba()` to compute the product of two numbers using the Karatsuba algorithm. The function takes two numbers as input and returns their product.

To use this implementation, you can simply call the `karatsuba()` function with two numbers as input:

```python
x = 1234
y = 5678
product = karatsuba(x, y)
print(product) # Output: 7006652
```

This will output the product of the two input numbers using the Karatsuba algorithm.

Note that this implementation assumes that both `x` and `y` are positive integers. If either number is negative or a floating-point number, you will need to make some modifications to the code.
