# Graph Coloring with Backtracking

The Graph Coloring problem is a classic problem in computer science and graph theory that involves assigning colors to the vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This means that no two vertices connected by an edge can be assigned the same color.

This code provides an implementation of the Graph Coloring problem using a backtracking approach. The algorithm works by recursively assigning colors to vertices until a valid solution is found. If a solution is not possible, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different color for the previously assigned vertex.

To use the program, create a Graph object and add edges using the `add_edge()` method. Then call the `graph_coloring()` method with the number of colors you want to use. The output will be a list of colors assigned to each vertex.

Backtracking approach in solving the Graph Coloring problem:

The backtracking approach is one of the most popular algorithms for solving the Graph Coloring problem. It starts with an empty solution and recursively assigns colors to vertices until a valid solution is found or all possible solutions have been explored.

The backtracking algorithm begins by assigning a color to a vertex and checking if the assignment is valid according to the problem constraints. If it is not valid, the algorithm backtracks and tries another color for the previous vertex. This process continues until either a valid solution is found or all possible configurations have been tried.

The key to the backtracking approach is the concept of "pruning" the search tree by discarding invalid configurations early on. In the case of the Graph Coloring problem, this means checking if a given color assignment violates any of the problem constraints before moving on to the next vertex. By eliminating invalid configurations early on, the algorithm can efficiently search for the correct solution.

Overall, the backtracking approach is particularly useful in problems such as the Graph Coloring problem because there are many possible configurations to explore. By eliminating invalid configurations early on, the algorithm can efficiently search for the correct solution without exploring all possible configurations.
