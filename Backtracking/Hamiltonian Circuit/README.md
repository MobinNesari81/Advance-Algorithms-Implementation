# Hamiltonian Circuit with Backtracking

To use this code, create a Graph object and add edges using the `add_edge()` method. Then call the `hamiltonian_cycle()` method to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. The output will be a list of vertices in the Hamiltonian cycle.

The `is_safe()` function checks if it is safe to add a given vertex to the current path. It checks if the vertex is adjacent to the last vertex in the path and if it has not already been visited.

The `ham_cycle_util()` function is a recursive function that attempts to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. It starts with vertex 0 and attempts to add each possible vertex to the path. If it can't find a valid solution, it backtracks and tries a different vertex.

The `hamiltonian_cycle()` function initializes an empty path and calls `ham_cycle_util()` to solve the problem. If there is a valid solution, it prints the list of vertices in the Hamiltonian cycle and returns True. Otherwise, it prints "No solution exists" and returns False.

Backtracking approach in solving the Hamiltonian circuit problem:

The Hamiltonian circuit problem is a classic problem in computer science and graph theory that involves finding a cycle that visits every vertex in a graph exactly once. This means that no two vertices are visited more than once, and the cycle ends where it starts.

The backtracking approach is one of the most popular algorithms for solving the Hamiltonian circuit problem. It works by recursively building a path from vertex to vertex until a valid Hamiltonian cycle is found or all possible cycles have been explored.

The backtracking algorithm begins by adding a vertex to the path and checking if the new vertex is safe according to the problem constraints. If it is not safe, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different vertex. This process continues until either a valid Hamiltonian cycle is found or all possible configurations have been tried.

The key to the backtracking approach is the concept of "pruning" the search tree by discarding invalid configurations early on. In the case of the Hamiltonian circuit problem, this means checking if a given path violates any of the problem constraints before moving on to the next vertex. By eliminating invalid configurations early on, the algorithm can efficiently search for the correct solution.

Overall, the backtracking approach is particularly useful in problems such as the Hamiltonian circuit problem because there are many possible configurations to explore. By eliminating invalid configurations early on, the algorithm can efficiently search for the correct solution without exploring all possible configurations.
