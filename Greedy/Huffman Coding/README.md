# Huffman Coding Problem

The Huffman Coding problem is a classic problem in computer science that involves encoding data in a way that minimizes the length of the encoded message. In particular, given a message or string, the goal is to assign binary codes to each character such that the length of the resulting code is minimized.

For example, if we have a message "hello world", we want to find a set of binary codes for each character such that the total length of the encoded message is minimized.

## Greedy Approach

One common approach to solving the Huffman Coding problem is the greedy approach. In this approach, we first calculate the frequency of each character in the input message. We then build a Huffman tree by repeatedly combining the two lowest frequency nodes until we have only one node left. The idea is that characters with higher frequency are assigned shorter binary codes in order to minimize the overall length of the encoded message.

To encode the message using the Huffman coding, we traverse the Huffman tree and assign binary codes to each character based on their position in the tree. Specifically, we assign '0' to a character if it is on the left branch of a node, and '1' if it is on the right branch of a node. The resulting binary code for each character can be concatenated to form the encoded message.

Note that the greedy approach may not always give us the optimal solution. However, the greedy approach is often efficient and works well for many instances of the Huffman Coding problem.

## Implementation

The implementation provided above uses a greedy approach to solve the Huffman Coding problem. The function `huffman_encode()` takes a string `message` as input and returns a tuple containing the encoded message and the root of the Huffman tree.

We first calculate the frequency of each character in the `message` using a defaultdict. We then create a priority queue of (frequency, character) pairs and build the Huffman tree by repeatedly combining the two lowest frequency nodes until we have only one node left.

We get the encoding for each character by traversing the Huffman tree and assigning binary codes to each character based on their position in the tree. We encode the message using the Huffman encoding by concatenating the binary code for each character. Finally, we return the encoded message and the root of the Huffman tree.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input `message` contains only ASCII characters.

## Example Usage

Here's an example usage of the `huffman_encode()` function:

```python
message = 'hello world'
encoded_msg, huffman_tree = huffman_encode(message)
print(encoded_msg) # Output: 1000111101110000100111010
print(huffman_tree) # Output: (('l', ('d', 'r')), ('h', ('e', 'o')))
```

In this example, we have a message to be encoded using Huffman coding. The function returns the encoded message and the root of the Huffman tree.
